## About the Project

### Tech Stack

1. [Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/)
3. [Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
4. [SQlLite](https://www.sqlite.org)

### Local Setup

You should have Python 3.9 installed on your system. You can get the latest version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You should also have [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), a virtual environment manager for Python. It will ensure that you download the required dependencies in a virtual environment and not globally.

``` terminal
pip install --user pipenv
```

Here is how you can set up the entire project on your system from the command line:

``` terminal
git clone https://github.com/aditd/thames.git
cd travel
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Overview

This is a simple e-travel website made by me. I scraped data from bookings.com using Selenium.
