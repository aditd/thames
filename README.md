### Local Setup

You should have Python 3.9 installed on your system. You can get the latest version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You should also have [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), a virtual environment manager for Python. It will ensure that you download the required dependencies in a virtual environment and not globally.

``` terminal
pip install --user pipenv
```

Here is how you can set up the entire project on your system from the command line:

``` terminal
git clone https://github.com/Tashi21/travel.git
cd travel
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python manage.py runserver
```

### Overview

This is a simple e-travel website made for our Advanced Programming course, taught by Professor Anirban Mondal, in our 3rd semester at Ashoka. The backend for the website was developed by Adit and Paritosh, and the frontend by Adit, Paritosh, and Shriman.

This time we incorporated our learnings from the last project and divided backend and frontend clearly amongst ouselves. This helped streamline our workflow and didn't result in many bottlenecks.

Paritosh finally compiled all the code together and linked the backend to the frontend.
